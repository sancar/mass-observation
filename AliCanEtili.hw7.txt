1.What did you think of Google Code?

It's a very useful tool I think. It provides various functionalities that 
we needed for our team project. And I think the best part of Google Code is
easy track of changes.


2.What did you think about your project?

I think it's a very useful and serviceable project.
Project can be carried out into real life in various areas.
I'm working in a consulting firm and there is a similarity
between the work consulting firms do and the work that our project does.
You collect data according to customer's requests and make analyses
of gathered data and make suggestions to the customer. Customer may 
be a person who wants to open a private hospital in Hisarustu and he needs
information about hospitals(price,quality,service..) and people's needs.
So, I think that our project can be utilized in different areas.



3.Would you like to work on this project in CMPE 451?

Yes, I'd like to work on this project in Cmpe451. I'd want to see the 
project working and being utilized in many business services.


4.Do you feel you have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering?

Yes, both the book and the google code helped me a lot. Google code helped
 in the "tools" part, and actually more interesting part was "approaches" in software engineering.
Now I can see that there is more than just 
the design, implementation, codes etc..
There are different personalities, project manager's
responsibilities, risk analyzing.. So in general it was a good experience taking this course and 
learning the connection between software projects and human relations.
