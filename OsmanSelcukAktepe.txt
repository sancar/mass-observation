
1.What did you think of Google Code?

Google code creates an oppurtunity to complete project succesfully and communicate others. Also in this way the advance can be seen very easily
Moreover we can feedback from others who are not in the project.

2.What did you think about your project?
I think this project can be very useful if some of its properties will be changed. Because applicablity is a little bit low. Especially in mobile platform there are a lot of compability problem.
But the data collection can be very effective for people who needs information. So if we update this project and change the problems like compability or data traffic which is a little bit high the project will be applicable.

3.Would you like to work on this project in CMPE 451?
Yes I can but as I said the description and objective of this project must be updated. The design part can be easier but developing part can be so hard.

4.Do you feel you have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering?
I think this part is the most important part because by the way I saw how a project managed and how a team can work.
Also now I think one of the most important part is in a project communication with team members. Because if synchronization lost, everthing lost.
