# Introduction #


Mass Observation enables a mass number of people to observe a study of a question or an issue and collect all information in one place to access and analyze easily. Observations and accessing the result of observations will be done via a web interface or with a mobile application.

There are three components of the desired system:

First, there must be a means for a person (the initiator) to enter a study question (the observation event) and to make it available to a set of people (the observers). The initiator has the ability to choose the group by email, by direct permission, or simply make it public to everyone.

Second, there must be a means for observers to
observe. This may include writing texts, voting on polls, taking pictures and/or videos,
providing audio commentary.

Third, there must be a means of collecting observations and making them
available for analysis and viewing. The Initiator may choose to make observations public (perhaps
anonymously), or to summarize the collection of observations.
