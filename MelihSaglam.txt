What did you think of Google Code?

Before this course, I was even unaware of the existence of such a platform like Google
Code and when I first heard of it during the class, I wondered what it would look
like. But after using it for a couple of weeks, I have found it particularly useful
to develop a project as a small-to-middle group of people. Its interface, especially
the Wiki page and the Issues system were convenient for project development.



What did you think about your project?

I think our project was interesting, because other than technical aspects, our project
included a social perspective, both required and provided communication between
owners and users. The observation sharing system can be useful in real life, and
I have seen many similar examples of it. That's why I can say that I liked our
project.



Would you like to work on this project in CMPE 451?

I have examined the projects of other groups as well, and I think that this project
is more fun to work with, and now that I have gained an insight on its implementation
while working on the documentation, I would prefer working on this project to the 
other projects. 



Do you feel you have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering?

Yes. I have learned many techniques in software development, and had the chance to
use some interesting software development platforms, such as Google Code. This was
the first time for me to work in such a large project group, because up to now, my largest
project group consisted of only 2 people. 
Furthermore, I learned the importance of group communication. Other than knowledge,
I also gained some valuable experience during this semester about software development.
