Mass Observation enable a mass number of people to observe a study of a question or an issue and collect all information in one place to access and analyze easily. Observations will be made using consumer devices that support mobile applications{ e.g Android, iPhone, Blackberry, Smartphone} and accessing the result of observations will be done via a web interface or again with a mobile application.

There are three components of the system:

Initiation: There is a means for an **Initiator** to enter a study question (**observation event**) and make it available to a set of people (Observers). The Initiator chooses the group by name, email, region or some other means.

Observation: There is a means for **Observers** to observe, i.e. answer questions, make notes, take pictures, provide audio or video commentary.

Consumption: There is a means for a **Consumer** to collect and analyse observations.

For more detail, see http://score-contest.org/2011/projects/Fickas.MOb.pdf.

**Examples of Use**

**Transportation:** An initiator (a private citizen or a government agency) might call upon the citizens of a city or region to help answer questions about the accessibility of transportation. Observations, both good and bad, will be collected. See, for instance, the Complete Streets Assessment tool (CSAT): http://www.uoregon.edu/~schlossb/be_gis.html.

**Livability:** similar to transportation, citizens could be asked to observe positive and negative aspects of daily living within a region. For instance, see the Photovoice project: http://www.wvphotovoice.org/.

**Citizen Science:** Recruit field observers for a science project. For instance, perhaps a mobile version of Celebrate Urban Birds: http://www.birds.cornell.edu/celebration.

**Games:** A simple game would be a treasure hunt with observations as "proof", e.g.,

# Current Status #

Currently we have finished our 3rd milestone which completes the Observer user's functionality. Our remaining task is to finish the Consumer part.
