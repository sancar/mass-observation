1. What did you think of Google Code?

Google Code is really helpful for not only developing team but also for individual developers as well.
With Google Code, we gained the ability to summarize our works to customers, we can show what we have done 
so far via Wiki and we can see the issues related to out project via Issues page. It is so well-organized that
there is no problem in order to understand it.
Google Code environment is a basic need for a software developer when developing within a team or developing by 
himself. If you are going to be a good software developer, then you should use some environment like Google Code.

2. What did you think about your project?

My project is Mass Observation. The aim of this project to help people get the answers of their questions about
some places. The participants are all voluntary.
In order to implement this project, developers should have knowledge of mobile programming. 

3. Would you like to work on this project in CMPE 451?

Implementation phase would be somewhat difficult. I dont know at the moment, so lets say maybe :)

4. Do you feel you have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering?

Of course. It was my first experience with Google Code and I'm sure it will be really helpful in my 
working times.
