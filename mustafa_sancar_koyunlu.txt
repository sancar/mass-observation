1) What did you think of Google Code?
Google code is a fine tool which enables good solutions to team development systems. I used github which is a similar tool to google code.
I think it is more easy to use . But i am not sure about its functionalities, because i did not use sophistacated functionalities then. 

2) What did you think about your project?
Mob system is  a good project and idea . It can be used by lot of people if implemented with a easy-to-use interface.

3)Would you like to work on this project in CMPE 451?
Yes, i want to work on this project.

4)Do you feel you have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering?
Yes, i did. I was already familiar with uml and google code like systems, but in this course i gain more insides of them.
As a new tool, i learned mercurial(svn).Other than tools, issues about the importance of planning, testing, configuration 
and people management was really instructive.
