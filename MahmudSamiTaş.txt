1) What did you think of Google Code?

Google Code is an organizing environment for project groups. It's helpful for issue management, communication and keeping track of 
all previous advancements and communications. Also it's compatibility with svn programs and it's serving as a repository and backup 
for project codes are very important.

2) What did you think about your project?

It can be used among public users. It may be useful at some points in real life. This project can be integrated to small to medium size 
social network sites. For example, bucampus.com for Bogazici University. Some aspects of the project might be hard to implement, but it's still
not that hard in overall.

3)Would you like to work on this project in CMPE 451?

I have already taken CMPE 451 course and I worked on Schematizing Maps project. Mass Observation is also a nice project but i would still prefer
Schematizing Maps.

4)Do you feel you have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering?

Yes. I have worked on many project since it's my fifth year in the school, I've taken CMPE 451 course, worked at the Industry and I'm going to 
graduate in a few weeks. Therefore, I have some experience about Software Engineering. However, this course made my mind clear about many 
principles, especially about group communication. Moreover, this course made me think about the importance of using svn.
